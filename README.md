# Conti Payments

This repository contains data of 75 Bitcoin addresses that we attribute as ransomware payments to the Conti ransomware groups. A full explanation of our methodology can be found in our paper, [Money Over Morals: A Business Analysis of Conti
Ransomware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11681).

Files:

- `labeled_addresses.csv`: the 666 addresses found in the Conti leaks, labeled by address type
- `expanded_conti_addresses.csv`: the 75 addresses that we attribute as being likely ransom payment addresses
